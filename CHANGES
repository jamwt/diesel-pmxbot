1110
====

With version 1110, much of the backward compatibility around quotes and karma
has been removed::

 - The Karma store must now be referenced as `pmxbot.karma:Karma.store` (a
   class attribute). It is no longer available as `pmxbot.pmxbot:karma` nor
   `pmxbot.util:karma` nor `pmxbot.karma.karma`.
 - Similarly, the Quotes store must now be referenced as
   `pmxbot.quotes:Quotes.store` (a class attribute).

Other backward-incompatible changes::

 - The `config` object has been moved into the parent `pmxbot` package.

Other changes::

 - Renamed `pmxbot.botbase` to `pmxbot.core`. A backward-compatibility
   `botbase` module is temporarily available to provide access to the public
   `command`, `execdelay`, and similar decorators.
